# Bow Trainer

This comprises of 2 projects.

1. A bow trainer handle.

This is an ambidextrous handle that can be attached to clini bands for drills and other coaching instruction.

2. A release trainer.

This is attached to the trainer handle by paracord. You then raise this as you would a bow and pull till it releases.

This should be a 'surprise' release. The idea is to train the archer into how the bow should react when you shoot with the correct back entension - namely that where the bow and string hands travel after release is a *reaction* not an *action*

This is still work in progress.

You need to put elastic bands around the end of the trainer to keep pressure on the latch. The amount of tension on the elastic can be adjusted to make the release easier or harder.
